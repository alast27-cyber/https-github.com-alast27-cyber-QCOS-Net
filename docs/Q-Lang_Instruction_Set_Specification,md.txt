Q-Lang Instruction Set Specification

Q-Lang is the secure, compiled quantum assembly language contained within the Payload Block of a CHIPS packet. It is a high-level assembly optimized for clarity, security, and direct mapping to universal gate sets, making it hardware-agnostic at the compiler level.

Q-Lang instructions follow a strict, standardized format: [INSTRUCTION TYPE] [OPERAND::VALUE] [TARGET_REGISTER].

I. Resource Allocation Directives (The Header)

These directives define the quantum and classical resources required for the job and must appear at the beginning of the Q-Lang script.

Directive

Syntax

Description

Quantum Register

QREG ALLOC <count>

Allocates <count> number of physical Qubits (Q[0] up to Q[count-1]) on the DQN hardware.

Classical Register

CREG ALLOC <count>

Allocates <count> number of Classical Bits (C[0] up to C[count-1]) used to store measurement results and loop counters.

Example:

QREG ALLOC 5
CREG ALLOC 3


II. Core Execution Operands (Quantum Gates)

These are the fundamental operations executed by the QEM's Control Electronics. All quantum operations use the keyword EXECUTE.

A. Single-Qubit Operations

Operand

Gate

Syntax

Description

OP::H

Hadamard

EXECUTE OP::H Q[i]

Puts Qubit i into a superposition state ($\frac{

OP::X

Pauli-X (NOT)

EXECUTE OP::X Q[i]

Flips the state of Qubit i ($

OP::Z

Pauli-Z

EXECUTE OP::Z Q[i]

Applies a phase flip to the $

OP::S

Phase (P)

EXECUTE OP::S Q[i]

Applies the $\pi/2$ phase gate.

OP::T

$\pi/8$ Gate

EXECUTE OP::T Q[i]

Applies the $\pi/4$ phase gate.

OP::Rz

Rotation Z

EXECUTE OP::RZ Q[i] <angle>

Rotates the state vector around the Z-axis by <angle> radians.

B. Multi-Qubit (Entangling) Operations

These gates are crucial for creating entanglement and complex computation.

Operand

Gate

Syntax

Description

OP::CNOT

Controlled-NOT

EXECUTE OP::CNOT Q[c], Q[t]

Flips target qubit t if control qubit c is $

OP::SWAP

Swap Gate

EXECUTE OP::SWAP Q[i], Q[j]

Swaps the quantum states of Qubit i and Qubit j.

OP::TOFFOLI

CCNOT

EXECUTE OP::TOFFOLI Q[c1], Q[c2], Q[t]

Flips target t if both controls c1 and c2 are $

OP::C4Z

4-Control-Z

EXECUTE OP::C4Z Q[c1], Q[c2], Q[c3], Q[c4]

Applies a Z phase flip if all four control qubits are in the $

III. Control Flow and Measurement

These directives manage the script's flow and extract the final classical results.

Directive

Syntax

Description

MEASURE

MEASURE Q[i] -> C[j]

Performs a measurement on Qubit i, collapsing its state, and stores the resulting classical bit (0 or 1) in Classical Register j.

BARRIER

BARRIER Q[i], Q[j]

A synchronization primitive. Prevents the QEM's optimizer from reordering gates across the barrier line.

LOOP START

@LABEL LOOP START <count>

Defines the beginning of a code block to be executed exactly <count> times. Requires a unique @LABEL.

LOOP END

LOOP END

Defines the end of the most recently started loop block.

JUMP-IF

JUMP-IF @LABEL C[i] == 1

Conditional jump instruction. If Classical Register i holds 1, the program execution jumps to the defined @LABEL.

IV. Q-Lang Script Example (Simple Entanglement)

This script allocates two qubits, creates a Bell state ($|\Phi^+\rangle$), and measures the results.

# --- 1. RESOURCE ALLOCATION ---
QREG ALLOC 2
CREG ALLOC 2

# --- 2. PREPARATION (Create Bell State: Q[0] and Q[1] are entangled) ---
EXECUTE OP::H Q[0]   # Put Q[0] in superposition
EXECUTE OP::CNOT Q[0], Q[1] # Entangle Q[1] to Q[0]

# --- 3. MEASUREMENT (Result will always be 00 or 11) ---
MEASURE Q[0] -> C[0]
MEASURE Q[1] -> C[1]

# --- 4. FINISH ---
